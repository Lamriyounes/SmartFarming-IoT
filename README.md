Project : Realization of the prototype of a IoT(Internet of Things) intelligent irrigation system


General introduction

In our final year project we proposed an intelligent control and irrigation system. The main 
goal of our system is to help a simple farmer, with a very simple equipment, easy to handle 
and with an unbeatable price. The objective is to intelligently control an agricultural area and 
to provide monitoring and automation without a great effort.
